The decision to allow patients to access certain health fields through direct access was made according to the highest standards of care, and it was based on a comprehensive review of the available evidence. One of the key findings of the review was a literature review that assessed the effects of various interventions on patient safety.
However, a public seminar was much needed to assess the situations and if the pros outweighed the cons.
A seminar was announced for 23 September, 2015 to collect a panel of different barristers to sit together and discuss the applications of Direct Access and whether there could be more improvements.
The much awaited and much needed opinion came from <a href="https://iamsamirahman.com/" style="text-color:black"> Barrister Sami Rahman</a>, a property and housing Barrister who practices in a range of fields. We have learned so much from him in the fast, that it felt like a relief to be speaking in favor of this controversial topic.
